#### Help support us with a coffee donation

Donâ€™t you just hate it when you download a plugin and you find out that in order to use it you have to buy a pro version? 

Even bigger problem is when you use a plugin and then just out of the blue the developer decides to add a pro version and he either changes the way the plugin works or he converts some of the free functions to paid ones.

We sure did hate that and a few years back we decided to start creating some of the plugins ourselves and we decided to share them all with the WordPress community **100% FREE**. 

Nowadays we have more than 15 plugins and you can download and use them all for free by [Clicking Here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/yydevelopment/).

If you liked this plugin and you want to help support our cause, [buy us a coffee](https://www.yydevelopment.com/coffee-break/?plugin=advanced-301-and-302-redirect). Studies show that coffee helps with creating WordPress plugins.

= What is a 301 redirect? =

A 301 redirect is a page redirect we mostly use when we have 404 errors on the website (when a page is removed). The301 redirect we make is a permanent redirect and it will redirect the visitors and google to different page on the site.

= What is a 302 redirect? =

A 302 redirect is a temporary redirect saying that the page was moved to different location temporary. We mainly use that redirect on affiliate links and when we don't want to give seo juice to the new page.
